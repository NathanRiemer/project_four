## Review Mode

Over time positive and negative on each day (net would definitely be useful)

A teacher's net vs another teacher's net (one science teacher vs another science teacher)

Same kids different teachers


For problem behavior kids:
Time of day
Subject
Teacher

For a single kid view, looking at a day, highlight different teachers or classes

A kid's data points can be expanded to see more details about them.

Don't just use net - it's helpful to see both positive and negative

Compare kids (without names)

Look at a group of kids

A line graph for an individual student that shows net total over time.


## Other features

Track student's average daily results, if they deviate by a large amount notify the teacher of it.

Customize quick selects for individual students, groups of kids, or everyone

Flag on a student with an important note

Instead of positive negative buttons, a few more buttons that are customizable

Note times default to NOW but can be specified

If a specials teacher leaves a note for a student it figures out when that student was in class with that teacher and sets the time accordingly.

Teacher can flag notes as requiring a parent phone call. 

Phone call flagged notes trigger a reminder at end of day with list of all calls to make

Phone call flagged notes can be marked as completed

Teachers can review phone calls, see which kids are getting them and why.

Give a positive/negative record to everyone

Think about whether this should be visible to teachers only, or also to parents and/or students.
